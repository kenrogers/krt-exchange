# KRT Exchange

A simple DEX built using React, Hardhat, Tailwind, and Solidity.

Uses an ERC20 standard to create the Ken Rogers Token (KRT) and allows the user to exchange this token for ETH.

Project is currently still in progress. The majority of the smart contract functionality and associated tests have been created, the frontend React app still needs to be created.

The frontend will be built using React, Tailwind, and ethers.js.
