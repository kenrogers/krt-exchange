# KRT Exchange

A simple DEX built using React, Hardhat, Tailwind, and Solidity.

Uses an ERC20 standard to create the Ken Rogers Token (KRT) and allows the user to exchange this token for ETH.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies with `yarn`
2. Compile smart contracts with `npx hardhat compile`
3. Test that everything is working with `npx hardhat test`

Once we verify that all test are passing, we can set up our Hardhat node with `npx hardhat node`.

That will give us a list of addresses and private keys that we can use for testing purposes.
